# Black-pixels
Determining the content of black pixels in the photos

The photo should be displayed in a list (UITableView) by clicking the cell (UITable view cell)
 to start determining the content of black pixels in the photo

There should also be a button that launches all photos for processing (Navigation bar item)

photos in processing should be displayed in the list as processed (Activiti indicator), photos that have received a percentage of black pixels should display them (Label with "17% black" text as example). Photos that have zero black pixels must be marked in the "COMPLETELY WHITE" (Label text)

As you process, the list should be sorted from the blackest photo to the smallest. (The blackest at the top)
But in UItableTableView cell i suppose to view original size photos
